# Ollivier-Ricci curvature community identification

This work utilizes the graph Ollivier-Ricci curvature in network community detection.  The ORC-based community identification algorithm (ORCCI) is based on the idea of sequential removal of negatively curved edges symptomatic of high interactions.

### Extensions 
The ORCCI is extended to consider known node side information in the community detection algorithm. This improves the community detection performance based on a priori side information.



Language: The code package is available in Python and Matlab
